           <p>St. Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland, whose saint's day is celebrated annually on 30 November. Andrew was one of the original 12 apostles of Christ, and the brother of another apostle, Simon Peter. Both lived and worked as fishermen in Galilee.</p>
               
           <p>After Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection<br />
        He is said to have travelled to Greece to preach Christianity, where he was crucified at Patras on an X-shaped cross. This is represented by the diagonal cross, or 'saltire', on Scotland's flag.<br />
        
        Andrew's connection with Scotland relates to the legend that some of his remains were kept at the site that is now the town of St Andrews. A chapel was built to house the remains and became a place of pilgrimage.<br /><br />
        
        St. Andrew is also the patron saint of Greece and Russia.

           <p>St David is the patron saint of Wales, whose saint's day is celebrated annually on 1 March. His birth date is uncertain: suggestions range from 462 to 512. He is traditionally believed to be the son of Saint Non and the grandson of Ceredig ap Cunedda, king of Ceredigion. The Welsh annals placed his death 569 years after the birth of Christ, but Phillimore’s dating revised this to 601.</p>
               
           <p>St David was born on the south west coast of Wales, near the present day city of St Davids. His family was aristocratic. He was educated at a monastery and became a missionary, travelling through Wales and to south west England and Brittany to spread Christianity. He is also supposed to have visited Rome and Jerusalem. David founded a monastery where St Davids stands today. He died in 589 AD and was buried in the grounds of his own monastery. He has been the patron saint of Wales since the 12th century.
        </p>
        
                <p>He became renowned as a teacher and preacher, founding monastic settlements and churches in Wales, Dumnonia, and Brittany. His best known miracle is said to have taken place when he was preaching in the middleof a large crowd at the Synod of Brefi stands on the spot where the ground on which he stood is reputed to have risen up to form a small hill. A white dove, which became his emblem, was seen settling on his shoulder.</p>

           <p>Saint George was a soldier of Palestinian and Greek origins and a member of the Preatorian Guard for the Roman emperor Diocletian, born in what is now modern-day Turkey in around 280 AD and was sentenced to death around 303 AD, for refusing to recant his Christian faith. He became one of the most venerated saints and megalo - martyrs in Christianity, and was especially venerated by the Crusaders.</p>
               
           <p>England, Georgia, Catalonia and several other nation states, cities, universities, professions and organizations all claim Saint George as their Patron.</p>

           <p>Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, was a fifth-century Romano-British Christian missionary and Bishop in Ireland, also known as “Apostle of Ireland”.</p>
               
           <p>His father, Calpornius, was a Roman-British army officer and a deacon. Despite his family involvement in the church, the young Patrick was not a believer. His life was ordinary, and completely unexceptional, until the age of 16 when he was kidnapped, by Irish pirates and sold into slavery in Ireland. The next six years were spent imprisoned in the north of the island and he worked as a herdsmen of sheep and pigs on Mount Slemish in Co. Antrim.</p>
        
        <p>During this period, he became increasingly religious. After a vision led him to stow away on a boat bound for Britain, Patrick escaped back to his family. But then he had a dream that the Irish were calling him back to Ireland to tell them about God. This inspired him to return to Ireland as a priest, where he was active as a missionary during the second half of the 5th century. Early medieval tradition credits him with being the founder of Christianity in Ireland, converting a society practicing a form of Celtic polytheism. </p>
        <p>For twenty years he travelled the length and breadth of the island, baptizing people and establishing monasteries, schools and churches as he went. By the time he died on 17th March 461 (or 493), he left behind an organized church, the see of Armagh, and an island of Christians. This date – 17 March – has been commemorated as St Patrick's Day ever since.</p>
